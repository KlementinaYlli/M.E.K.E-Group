#What does our software consist of?

We used the CSV file provided to develop software that assists students in finding the school best suited to their specific needs. This tool analyzes data relating to schools in the Veneto region, allowing students to select an institution based on personalized criteria, such as school type, geographical location, and other relevant characteristics.

We used the details regarding the province, the number of services offered by each school and the city, contained in the CSV file.

From the main interface of our software, users can access a variety of services. Among these, there is the functionality that allows you to find the best school in a specific city, based on criteria such as the services offered. Additionally, you can search by filtering by the grade level of a school within a given province, making it easier to select primary, secondary or other level institutions in specific geographic areas.
Another important feature of the software is the ability to generate a list of schools based on the type of managing entity: public, private or religious.
